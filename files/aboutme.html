            I am from Jammu and Kashmir and there are 3 siblings in my family. Since class 12 I had interest in
programming and I always yearned to learn more. I am already good in c/c++ and currently I'm trying to
learn python.Apart from this I also like table tennis, reading books and watching satirical comedy
especially western show like the daily show, last week tonight.
